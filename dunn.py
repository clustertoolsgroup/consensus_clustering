    where :math:`d(c_i,c_j)` represents the distance between
    clusters :math:`c_i` and :math:`c_j`, given by the distances between its
    two closest data points, and :math:`diam(c_k)` is the diameter of cluster
    :math:`c_k`, given by the distance between its two farthest data points.
    
    The bigger the value of the resulting Dunn index, the better the clustering
    result is considered, since higher values indicate that clusters are
    compact (small :math:`diam(c_k)`) and far apart.
